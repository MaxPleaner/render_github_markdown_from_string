I wasn't able to get Github's official `markup` gem to work so I found another way to render github-flavored markdown strings to html.

This requires `pandoc` to be installed on the system.

_Usage_:

1. Save the [github_markdown.rb](./github_markdown.rb) file to your project.
2. See that file's source code for a usage example.
